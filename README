4AP.c employs the tri-diagonal algorithm to approximate the Heimholtz equation in one dimension:

u'' + (k^2)u = A

where k and A are constants. The program begins by reading a .config file which contains the values for both k and A, as well as the domain of interest,
the number of points with which to discretize the domain, and the two boundary conditions necessary to approximate the solution. The output is a tab 
separated text file containing the values for the independent variable as well as the approximation to the solution u. The .config file should be arranged
as follows:

******************************4AP.config******************************
<number of points with which to discretize the domain (integer only)>
<value for k>
<value for A>
<left endpoint of domain>
<right endpoint of domain>
<left boundary condition value if Dirichlet> OR *<left boundary condition value if Neumann>
<right boundary condition value if Dirichlet> OR *<right boundary condition value if Neumann>
**********************************************************************

The program uses double precision floating point datatypes.
